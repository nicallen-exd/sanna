# For developers using Claude Code with MCP connectors. Code reads,
# file edits, git operations on feature branches, and local testing are
# autonomous. Pushing to protected branches, publishing packages,
# staging DB writes, and system config require escalation. Production
# operations, sensitive data access, and destructive ops are halted.
